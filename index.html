            <p>You may be asking yourself what is a carbon footprint? Don't worry we have the answer for you!!. A carbon foorprint is the way to track the amout of green house gas emmisions left by an individual.
                The reason for this is to know how we are impacting the enviroment and to find a solution some of the things we can do to help. The enviroment currently has disasters and its not bright for the future generations to come. 
                Not many people know how much their every day actions impacts the enviroment, a carbon footprint will help one understand much you impact the enviroment.
                Although people mostly assume that it involves you driving a car and the emmisions its more diverse than that. The amount of meat eaten to the ammount of appliances in use can affect the enviroment in different ways.
