        <div id="description1">
            <p>you may be asking yourself what is a carbon footprint? dont worry we have the answer for you!!. in the most basic way of explaining it a carbon foorprint is the way to track the amout of green house gas emmisions left by an individual.
                you may be asking why do we want to get the GHG emissions for an individual? the reason fo this is to know how we are empacting the enviroment and find a solution for what are some of the things we can do to help. the enviroment is in disasters and its not looking good for the future we should help right?. 
                little do people know that their every day actions is impacting the enviroment, a carbon footprint should help you see how you are impacting the enviroment and what you can do to help, although people mostly assume that it involves you driving a car and the emmisions its more diverse than that. the amount of meat that you eat to the ammount of appliances that you have plugged in can effect the enviroment.
